# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis

This repository contains a R Markdown analysis on the Titanic dataset which was obtained from the popular online data science community Kaggle and contains information on whether passengers' survival status, their sex, age, what class they were in ($1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$ or $3^{rd}$), whether they had siblings/parents/children aboard, what fare they paid for their ticket and where they embarked from.
