# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis

This repository contains a R Markdown analysis on the Titanic dataset which was obtained from the popular online data science community [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and contains information on whether passengers' survival status, their sex, age, what class they were in (1st, 2nd or 3rd), whether they had siblings/parents/children aboard, what fare they paid for their ticket and where they embarked from. The aim for the analysis is to firstly assess whether any of the variables in the dataset have an effect on a passengers' survival status and if so, how much of an effect and secondly we want to observe how good the Logistic Regression model fitted is at predicting unseen data. The analysis contains basic data cleaning and data visualisations followed by a Logistic Regression classification model and assessment of its performance.
